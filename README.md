## What'll you learn?
* In **Subpart 1**, we'll talk about some simple search algorithms and Kalman Filter.
* In **Subpart 2**, we'll talk about **Reinforcement Learning** and you'll learn to make your own environments for training.
* In **Subpart 3**, you'll get to train your own very first model from scratch!!
